SOFTWARE
============================================================================
This software provides all the functions needed to compute approximate
solutions to Poisson's problem using the lowest order virtual element method 
on polygonal meshes.

The 'meshes' subdirectory also contains the following files

L-domain.mat         : contains a description of a Voronoi polygonal mesh of 
                       an L-shaped domain
non-convex.mat       : contains a description of a mesh of a square-shaped
                       domain consisting of non-convex polygonal elements
smoothed-voronoi.mat : contains a description of a mesh of a square-shaped 
                       domain, formed of a Voronoi mesh which has been smoothed 
                       using Lloyd's algorithm as implemented by PolyMesher
squares.mat          : contains a description of a mesh of a square-shaped 
                       domain consisting of square elements
triangles.mat        : contains a description of a mesh of a square-shaped
                       domain consisting of triangular elements
voronoi.mat          : contains a description of a Voronoi mesh of a 
                       square-shaped domain, formed using random centroids

An explanation of the data structures used to describe the meshes in these
files is provided in the paper “The virtual element method in 50 lines of
MATLAB”, along with illustrations of each mesh (shown in Figure 1).

HOW TO INSTALL
============================================================================

Unpack vem_50lines.zip. The directory vem_50lines will be created with all
the needed files inside. Add the directory vem_50lines to the path in
Matlab or change the current working directory to vem_50lines.

============================================================================
HOW TO USE
============================================================================

Running the method simply involves calling the 'vem' function with the
following three arguments:
    1. the path to a mesh file, e.g. 'meshes/voronoi.mat'
    2. a function handle to a function implementing the PDE right hand side,
       e.g. @square_domain_rhs
    3. a function handle to a function implementing the PDE boundary 
       condition, e.g. @square_domain_boundary_condition


For example, Figure 3(a) in the paper 'The virtual element method in 50 
lines of MATLAB' can be produce by calling:

u = vem('meshes/voronoi.mat',@square_domain_rhs, ...
	@square_domain_boundary_condition);
view(150,30)

Similarly, Figure 3(b) can be produced by running:

u = vem('meshes/L-domain.mat', @L_domain_rhs, @L_domain_boundary_condition);
view(120,30)

These compute the solution to a Poisson problem on a square domain and an
L-shaped domain, respectively.
